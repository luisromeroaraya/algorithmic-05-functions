# Functions
* Type of challenge: **learning**
* Duration: **30 min**
* Team challenge: **solo**

## Learning objectives
At the end of this challenge you should:
* understand the concept of functions
* be able to write custom functions

## The mission
This challenge will have you play around with the concept of [functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subroutine), complete the exercises down below after youâ€™ve read the explanations.

A function is a subroutine, meaning a piece of instructions executed if called within the main code. It can be used multiple times with different sets of value each call. It usually needs to return a value with the return command.

Example
```
// This function returns the square of a number
function square(nbr) {
	return $nbr * $nbr
}

output(square(5))// prints "25"
```

## Exercises

*I will be using [Python3](https://repl.it/languages/python3) to write and test the algorithms*

Instructions
- [ ] translate five previous exercises into modular functions
- [ ] detail each and every step
